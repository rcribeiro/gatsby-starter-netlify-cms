  the same old things, but I want you to know that you can always learn from
  them.

First, find something you are either interested in, or something that is useful to the world, and build up a depth of knowledge in that skill. (It is better to have deep knowledge of a fundamental skill than any pin-point field of knowledge). You don't need to be the expert, but pretty close to an "expert" level of proficiency in that skill. Learn it, own it.

Then, and only then, start branching out into other subjects and areas, and gain a wide breadth of knowledge. Learn whatever you like, because your practice building up a level of depth in one topic already should have taught you how to handle \[usefully] learning a topic. Maybe you'll find a new favorite topic this time. You just need a strong "root" in some skill or field first.

In short, the world wants and needs generalists or "broad thinkers", but only respects expertise or narrow focus. Maybe there's a reason for it, maybe "it's just how it is", but that's what I've experienced so far.

Update: Oh, and don't worry about "filling your brain up". Your brain is a muscle, and if you do end up putting something in there that isn't useful or used often, your brain will metabolize it before you "need more space". Just focus on learning things completely -- always do your best.
